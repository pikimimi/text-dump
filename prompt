I need to create a new Next.js project for a music artwork app. My setup:

macOS
Latest stable Node.js and npm
Preference for minimal manual typing

Please provide a comprehensive guide with:

Exact terminal commands to:

Create a Next.js project with TypeScript and App Router
Set up Tailwind CSS
Install and configure shadcn/ui using the latest method:

Use 'npx shadcn@latest init' to initialize the project
Use 'npx shadcn@latest add [component]' to add components




Complete, copy-pastable code for all necessary files, including but not limited to:

next.config.js
tailwind.config.js
tsconfig.json
app/layout.tsx
app/page.tsx
components/MusicArtworkApp.tsx
Any required shadcn/ui component files


Full project directory structure
Instructions for handling npm audit warnings or errors
Explanation of each step's purpose

Ensure all code snippets are full and self-contained, requiring no additional typing. Format code blocks for easy copying.
After the setup, the project should be immediately runnable with 'npm run dev'.
If any step has multiple approaches, please explain briefly and recommend the best option for a beginner-friendly, maintainable setup.
Please confirm you understand the updated shadcn setup process and will use the new commands in your instructions.
